# No_Lineal_DataStructures

This repository contains examples and exercises related to non-linear data structures in the field of programming. Here you will find implementations and practices of the following data structures:

- **Binary Search Tree:** Implementations and exercises related to binary search trees (BSTs).
- **Trie:** Implementations of trie data structures.
- **Heap:** Implementations of heaps, including binary heaps and priority queues.
- **AVL Tree:** Implementations and exercises related to balanced AVL trees.
- **Graph:** Implementations and algorithms for working with graphs.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Implementations and examples of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest paths in graphs.
